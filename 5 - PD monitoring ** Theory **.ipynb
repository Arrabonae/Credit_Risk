    "__Population stability index (PSI)__\n",
    "\n",
    "PSI is a measure of how much a population has shifted over time or between two different samples of a population in a single number. It does this by bucketing the two distributions and comparing the percents of items in each of the buckets, resulting in a single number you can use to understand how different the populations are. The common interpretations of the PSI result are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* PSI < 0.1: no significant population change\n",
    "* PSI < 0.2: moderate population change\n",
    "* PSI >= 0.2: significant population change"
